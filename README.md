Julia code to assert accuracy and regularizing properties of modified hamiltonian with blow up
kinetic terms, as studied in [CHV][^1]. It is a simple top layer over the plane-wave density functional theory
package DFTK.jl[^2].

# Requirements: 
Julia 1.8. and above.

# Installing all dependancies
Open a Julia shell with `julia --project` in your local copy of this repository and call
```
using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(".")
``` 
to install all the needed dependancies.

# Usage
This code runs the computations to perform the numerical experiments from [CHV][^1] section 6.

To run the computations, first open the Julia shell with `julia --project` in your
local copy of this repository and call `include("launch_computations.jl")` to precompile
the code.  Two sets of general parameters are defined. The first one `Test_parameters` are
used to test that the code didn't break. The second one `Paper_parameters` correspond to the
parameters used in [CHV][^1].

From this point a simple call to the `launch_computations` function suffices to perform all numerical tests.
Let us do a very rough (but fast) computation for face centered cubic crystaline silicon with PBE exchange correlation functional.
Simply define an output directory with `mkdir("../silicon_PBE")` and call

```
launch_computations(silicon, blowup; Test_parameters..., output_dir="../silicon_PBE")
```

The code also supports graphene with PBE functional. Any other system can be added in `deps/test_cases.jl` 
by following the same syntaxe. Note that in the parameters, the arguments `bandplot_res` and `single_band_res` 
control the number of k-points respectively in the full band diagram and in the focus on a single band. 
The code uses basic finite-difference derivatives, which imposes to fix the parameters above `200` and `2000` respectively, 
to avoid numerical artifacts. The results of the paper are displayed for `bandplot_res=300` and `single_band_res=4000`.
Note that the process is time consuming for these parameters and have been run on a cluster.
